SCRIBA_VERSION: int = 7
"""Integer version of the core abstractions (Pipeline, Document, Renderer,
RenderArtifact, RenderContext). Bumped whenever the core API changes in a
way that invalidates consumer caches, independent of __version__.

Note: 0.6.0 keeps SCRIBA_VERSION = 3 (bumped 2→3 in 0.6.0-alpha1). The
``Document`` dataclass gained a new ``warnings: tuple[CollectedWarning, ...]``
field (RFC-002) and the Tree/Graph/Plane2D primitives gained structural
mutation APIs (RFC-001). The additions are backward-compatible at the read
side, but consumer caches keyed on primitive rendered output MUST invalidate
because new states (``hidden``) and new edge parsing (3-tuple weighted)
produce strictly different SVG. This is the first SCRIBA_VERSION break
since v0.1.1.

0.16.0 bumps 3→4: every SVG ``font-size`` is now emitted as
``calc(Npx * var(--scriba-diagram-font-scale, 1))`` and substory widget ids
became deterministic, so rendered HTML/SVG bytes differ from 0.15.x even at
the default scale. Consumer caches keyed on rendered output MUST invalidate.

0.17.0 bumps 4→5: the animation viewBox is now sized to the maximum extent
across all frames (size-changing primitives like Stack/Queue no longer clip),
and ``CodePanel`` renders its label as a top header bar instead of a bottom
caption. Both change rendered SVG/HTML bytes from 0.16.x; consumer caches
keyed on rendered output MUST invalidate.

0.18.0 bumps 5→6: Phase-2 render-content fixes alter SVG/HTML bytes — the
NumberLine axis and MetricPlot root now carry a ``scriba-state-*`` class
(``\\recolor`` honoured), directed graphs emit the arrow-marker ``<defs>``
once instead of twice, ``\\narrate`` resolves ``${compute}`` bindings,
``\\apply`` captions and ``\\reannotate`` updates now render, and
``position=inside`` annotations are centred. Consumer caches keyed on
rendered output MUST invalidate.

0.19.0 bumps 6→7: Graph layout stability work changes node coordinates.
Node positions are now pinned across edge mutations (add_edge/remove_edge no
longer re-solve the layout), isolated (degree-0) nodes are placed in a
reserved inner lane instead of a canvas corner, and an unpinned
``layout="force"`` graph auto-selects the best-scoring seed (0–7) instead of
always using seed 42. Graphs that mutate edges, contain isolated nodes, or
rely on the default seed render different SVG bytes; consumer caches keyed on
rendered output MUST invalidate."""
